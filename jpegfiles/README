This directory contains a simple JPEG encoder. It is based on libjpeg
(see README_FROM_LIBJPEG), but only the bare necessities from libjpeg
has been included.

The core of the DCT and Huffman/RLE encoder are still here in somewhat
modified form, but nothing else is left of libjpeg. The idea is to
keep only the interesting parts of libjpeg (interesting for the TSEA44
course) and not worry about initialization, color images, buffering,
etc.

The modifications were done by Andreas Ehliar, Per Karlström, Olle
Seger, and Simon Törner.
